Hi,
I am pleased to showcase my analysis on an HR attrition Dashboard, focused on understanding and addressing employee turnover challenges within an organization. This analysis uncovers the factors driving attrition, quantifies the number of affected employees, and identifies departmental patterns. The findings provide actionable insights to enhance employee retention and foster a more engaged workforce.


Project Objectives:

1. Determine the reasons for employee attrition.
2. Quantify the number of employees affected.
3. Analyze department-specific attrition patterns.
4. Attrition with respect to Salary, Age group, and tenure in the company

The project aims to identify the causes of employee turnover, determine the scale of attrition, and examine departmental trends, salary, etc.

I Applied the following:
- Data Cleaning and Transformation
- Dax and measures to get the insight values
- Creating a Dashboard using appropriate visualization
- Documented insights & analysis for non-analytical individual

Insights:
1. Total employees: 1,470 with Attrition of 237 (150 males, 87 females)
2. Attrition: 237 employees (16.1% overall rate)
3. Highest attrition occupations: Laboratory Technician (62), Sales Executive (57), Research Scientist (47)
4. Attrition after completing one year in the organization: 59
5. Majority of attrition occurs within the age groups 26-35 and 18-25
6. Employees earning a monthly salary â‰¤ 5,000 rupees contribute to 21.8% attrition
7. Most attrition incidents occur after completing one year in the organization

Actions: Based on the analysis, it is evident that a significant majority of the employees (163 out of 237) who decided to leave the organization were receiving salaries below the company's average of 6.5K rupees. This observation provides an actionable insight that improving compensation for these individuals could potentially help reduce attrition rates within the company.

Tools used:
1. Power BI
2. Excel
3. Google
